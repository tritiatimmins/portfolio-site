  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>Bike Trader is a web app that allows users to create a profile, view bicycle classifieds, sell bicycles, and view a list of Bay Area Cycling events.</p>
  <p>Created March 4th 2016 - March 13th 2016</p>

  <h3> Role - Product Owner </h3>

  <p>To realize the product vision, I created a list of features I wanted to see in the app, and I presented these to the engineers. From there we collaborated on which features we thought fit the vision best and how feasible they would be to create. Then I prioritized the feature set and used that to define the MVP. After prioritizing the features I created wireframes of our product, and collaborated with our scrum master to plan sprint guidelines.</p>

 <h3> Valuable Takeaways </h3>
 <ul>
    <li>Managing deadlines and leading a team to realize a product vision requires empathetic communication.</li>
    <li>I learned that collaboration with engineers is really important when defining your MVP or prioritizing features. Their previous experience with building similar features can give good insight into the time it might take to implement a particular feature.</li>
    <li>Clarity is key when defining features. You have to be able to communicate one thing in a few different ways because your interpretation of how a feature works may be completely different than how another person percieves that feature.</li>
    <li>Underestimating the complexity of a feature can be dangerous! I took on the challenge of figuring out how to upload images on the front end and store them on the backend. I thought it seemed relatively straightforward, but it turns out this process was much more complicated than I initially thought. I learned that it's important to do some investigation into how to implement a feature when you're in the feature prioritization phase of your project.</li>
