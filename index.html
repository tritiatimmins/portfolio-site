						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>I am a Software Engineer and aspiring UX Designer dedicated to creating meaningful and intuitive experiences. I am fascinated by what motivates people's decision making. I believe that through testing and user research we can create applications that are more meaningful and easy to use. I started out my journey in tech on the engineering side, and after attending a UX conference in August 2016, I found myself totally fascinated by the field. I have a lot of fun writing code, but I am also passionate about understanding people. </p>

						<p>I still enjoy learning about front-end development. One of my favorite new technologies is React and React Native. Aside from technology, my interests revolve around technology, travel, design, and music. I love classical piano, and I love traveling. You can find out more about my trips <a href="http://blog.tritiatimmins.com">here</a>. I love to chat about anything and everything, so reach out to me on twitter or shoot me an email!</p>
