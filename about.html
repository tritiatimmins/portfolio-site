  <h2>Hi I'm Tritia</h2>
  <p>I am a UX Designer who started out wanting to be an engineer. I have a lot of fun writing code, but my real passion is about understanding people. I am fascinated by what motivates people's decision making, and I believe in using that information to create meaningful, intuitive experiences.  I also enjoy learning about front-end development. One of my favorite technologies is React-Native.</p>

  <p>My interests revolve around technology, travel, design, and music. I have been playing classical piano most of my life. My favorite piece in my repertoire is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVgkLNP8Oao">Chopin's op. 49</a>. I also love traveling, I've visited about 16 countries, but I know I've barely scratched the surface. I love to chat about anything and everything, so reach out to me on twitter or shoot me an <a href="mailto:tritialtimmins@gmail.com?Subject=Let's%20chat">email!</a></p>
